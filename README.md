- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christopher Ferguson, a Senior Economics Student at JMU. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and its applications to Finance, Science, and Soccer

Currently training myself in neural networks through Andrej Karpathy's youtube lectures. Will be exponentially more active once I graduate May 2023 and I can focus on the machine learning path.
